# Tic Tac Toe Game


This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. Players take turns to mark empty cells on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `TicTacToeGame.java` file.
3. Compile the Java program:

   ```bash
   javac TicTacToeGame.java

1. Run the compiled program:
```
java TicTacToeGame
```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns with another player and make your moves by entering the row and         column numbers for your move.

3. The game will display the current state of the board after each move. The game continues until a player wins or the     game ends in a draw.

# Features
1. Simple and intuitive text-based interface.
2. Two players can take turns on the same computer.
